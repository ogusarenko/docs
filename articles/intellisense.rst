The Esbonio language server implements many useful features.

Autocompletion

.. warning:: this feature is temporarily not available.

After typing ``:doc:`/`` you can use `the default VSCode keyboard shortcut

``^Space`` to trigger suggestions on file paths.

Document links

Directives like ``image``, ``figure``, ``include``, and ``literalinclude`` now
displayed as file links. You can use those links to jump to the linked files.
